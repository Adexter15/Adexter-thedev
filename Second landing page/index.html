     <h3>design to brag about</h3>
      <p>Erik ten Hag has got the goalkeeper he wants for next season. You have to say it's an incredible deal for Inter Milan, because they signed Onana last summer on a free transfer and are now selling him for up to almost Â£48m "Ten Hag knows him well because he worked with him at Ajax.</p>

    <div class="div car-2">
      <i class="fa-regular fa-calendar-days"></i>
     <h3>completely customizable</h3>
     <p> He's a bit of a contrast from David De Gea. Everyone talks about how you need a goalkeeper who's comfortable on the ball and can play out from the back in modern football, and Onana can certainly do that - he was exceptional for Inter, helping them get to the Champions League final.</p>

     <h3>loaded with power</h3>
     <p>"He has had a bit of history with Ten Hag before, they fell out a couple of times at Ajax and he was dropped, and he also served a nine-month ban for a doping violation, but Ten Hag wanted a new goalkeeper and he's got his man."
