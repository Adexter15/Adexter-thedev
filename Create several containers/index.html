      <h3>SNOWBALL</h3>
      <p>I made myself a snowball As perfect as could be. I thought I’d keep it as a pet And let it sleep with me. I made it some pajamas And a pillow for its head. Then last night it ran away, But rst—it wet the bed.</p>

      <p>Not to scratch his toes. Captain Hook must watch out And never pick his nose. Captain Hook must be gentle When he shakes your hand. Captain hook must be careful Openin’ sardine cans And playing tag and pouring tea and turnin’ pages of this book. Lots of folks I’m glad I ain’t— But mostly Captain Hook! </p>

        You’ve been up on that diving board Making sure that it’s nice and straight. You’ve made sure that it’s not too slick. You’ve made sure it can stand the weight. You’ve made sure that the spring is tight. You’ve made sure that the cloth won’t slip. You’ve made sure that it bounces right, And that your toes can get a grip— And you’ve been up there since half past ve Doin’ everything… but DIVE.

        Captain Hook must remember Not to scratch his toes. Captain Hook must watch out And never pick his nose. Captain Hook must be gentle When he shakes your hand. Captain hook must be careful Openin’ sardine cans And playing tag and pouring tea and turnin’ pages of this book. Lots of folks I’m glad I ain’t— But mostly Captain Hook!

      <h3>I WON’T HATCH</h3>
      <p>Oh I am a chicken who lives in an egg, But I will not hatch, I will not hatch. The hens they all cackle, the roosters all beg, But I will not hatch, I will not hatch. For I hear all the talk of pollution and war As the people all shout and the airplanes roar, So I’m staying in here where it’s safe and it’s warm, And I WILL NOT HATCH! </p>
