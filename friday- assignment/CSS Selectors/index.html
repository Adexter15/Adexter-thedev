  <p class="boy-cool">Every short story has three parts , which may be called
    Setting or Background , Plot or Plan , and Characters or Char
    acter . If you are going to write a short story, as I h0pe you
    are, you will find it necessary to think through these three
    parts so as to relate them interestingly and naturally one to
    the other ; and if you want to assimilate the best that is in the
    following stories , you will do well to approach them by the
    same three routes .</p>
    <p id="cause">The Setting or Background gives us the time and the place
      of the story with such details of custom,
      scenery , and dialect
      as time and place imply . It answers the questions Wnen ?
      W/tere ? The Plot tells us what happened . It gives us the
      incidents and events ,
      the haps or mishaps ,
      that are interwoven
      to make up the warp and woof of the story .</p>
      <p>Many books have been written about these three parts of a
        short story , but the great lesson to be learned is that the excel
        lence o f a story ,
        long or short , consists not in the separate
        excellence of the Setting or of the Plot o r of the Characters
        but in the perfect blending o f the three to produce a single
        effect or to impress a single truth . If the Setting does not fit
        the Plot ,
        if the Plot does not rise gracefully from the Setting,
        if the Characters do not move naturally and self-revealingly
        through both ,
        the story is a failure . Emerson might well have
        had our three parts of the short story in mind when he wrote ,</p>
