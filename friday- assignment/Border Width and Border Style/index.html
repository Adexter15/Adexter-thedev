  <div class="boys">Mousa really didn’t like being poor. He lived in a small house in a small village next to the River Nile in Egypt. When there was work, he worked on farms, and when there was no work, he watched the waters of the River Nile. Sometimes he dreamt that he was in a beautiful boat, going slowly up the river to Cairo. He dreamt of a new life there — a big house, lots of money, beautiful clothes and lots of food. One day, when there was no work and he was tired of looking at the Nile, he thought, ‘Enough is enough.’ He decided to leave for Cairo and become rich.</div>
  <div class="girls"> ‘Here’s some money for the journey. And Cairo is waiting for you! Good food, beautiful clothes, all the things that you’ve ever dreamt about. Good luck, Mousa. Come back rich!</div>
  <div class="people">
    ‘When the water buffalo has a calf I’ll have two water buffaloes to sell,’ he shouted. And after I sell them, I’ll be rich. And when I’m rich, I’ll have a servant to work for me. All day I’ll shout at him, «Do this! Do that! Quickly! Run!» And if he’s slow, I’ll give him a big kick, like this!’
